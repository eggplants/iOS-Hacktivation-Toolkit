# iOS Hacktivation Toolkit

### WORKING ON THE LATEST iOS FIRMWARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE (iOS 13.6.1)

This is an iOS Activation Lock Bypass Tool. I wrote this tool mainly because there is nothing out there for Linux (that i could find anyway). 

Looking for developers! This is a work in progress. If you think you can add to this project please get in touch!
